@ August 11, 2021

This business release is based on the Veritawall 21.1.8 community version
with additional reliability improvements.

The OpenVPN advisory tracked as CVE-2020-15078 does not affect the provided
version 2.4.11, but the security audit will falsely flag it as vulnerable
because the source of the audit is FreeBSD where OpenVPN was migrated to 2.5
series already.

API errors during the update can appear but are a harmless side effect of
the MVC framework major version transition to Phalcon 4.  The system will
reboot as normal.  Make sure to clear your browser cache if the check for
updates does not seem to work afterwards and/or double-check with a different
browser.
