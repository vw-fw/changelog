Hello there,

This is a quick 15.7.3 to address the recently released PHP 5.6.11 as well
as small fixes and further firmware experience improvements.  We've also
taken the time to refine our version 16.1 road map items for you to review
and discuss:

https://veritawall.org/about/road-map/

The full list of changes are as follows:

o ports: php 5.6.11[1]
o ports: pkg 1.5.5[2]
o ports: ca_root_nss 3.19.2
o ports: phalcon 2.0.5[3]
o ports: isc-dhcp42-server 4.2.8_1[4]
o backup: fix infinite reboot loop on interface mismatch
o firmware: show locally installed packages
o firmware: reboot dialog now responsively redirects when the system is back up
o dashboard: upgrade link now directly launches into the firmware upgrade
o dashboard: added a system log widget (contributed by Sascha Linke)
o languages: merged German translation progress (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o xmlrpc: fix sync of static routes
o bogons: fix overwrite-on-upgrade bug

That's all for now.  Really.


Enjoy the summer and stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
