Howdy partners,

So here are OpenSSL 1.0.2e and LibreSSL 2.2.5, finally!  15.7.22 itself is
only tweaks and minor fixes.  We take it as a good sign that there were no
"oh no what did you do to the menu" complaints in the past week.  Nobody
missed the RRD graphs either.  You guys are really cool.

The root cause for the filter reload timeout reports that some of you
encountered in 15.7.19 has finally been found.  The function
filter_generate_optcfg_array() could be called hundreds of times in a single
filter reload while only providing static interface data to the callers that
did not change over the runtime of the reload.  At some point it must have
gotten so slow that a caching mechanism was added around the function, which
caused the function's output to get stuck, causing the initial bug report.
Now it's as fast as ever and glitch-free.

Here are the full patch notes:

o dhcp: show lease description in status pages if available (contributed
  by Frank Wall)
o firewall: improve and align display of RFC 1918 and IANA rules (contributed
  by Manuel Faux)
o firewall: fix hover cursor on the filter log page (contributed by
  Manuel Faux)
o firewall: show implicit IPv6 block rule if enabled in system settings
  (contributed by Manuel Faux)
o firewall: extend pfInfo to show active rules (contributed by Manuel Faux)
o unbound: fix JS to enable/disable interface selector (contributed by
  Manuel Faux)
o unbound: fix starting of unbound via service status page (contributed by
  Manuel Faux)
o proxy server: allow authentication against all available authentication
  servers
o universal plug and play: fix read/write on the settings page
o interfaces: break device configuration pages out of interface assignment
  section
o backend: optimise filter reload to not collect overall interface information
  more than once
o backend: reapply the cache removal in light of the filter reload fixing
o backend: trigger config daemon templates on bootup
o backend: throw error when attempting to trigger a nonexistent template
o ports: curl 7.46[1]
o ports: openssl 1.0.2e[2]
o ports: libressl 2.2.5[3]
o ports: squid 3.5.12[4]
o ports: lighttpd 1.4.38[5]


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
