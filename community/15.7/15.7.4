Hello friends,

Another week it is, this time with a rather exciting TCP state fix in the
FreeBSD kernel.  We've also taken the time to work through most of the code
base to eradicate code warnings and now enable them by default in the crash
reporter.  We're half-expecting another stable update early next week just
to make sure your infrastructure keeps running as smoothly as possible.

Here are the the full patch notes:

o updated sudo 1.8.14p3[1], pcre 8.37_2[2], and FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE-p15[3]
o firmware: fix upgrade when using veritawall-devel package
o proxy: fix config write for multiple interfaces
o crash reporter: raise PHP log level to warnings after an extensive cleanup
o dashboard: made widgets translatable (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o firewall logs: usability improvements (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o languages: Simplified Chinsese 64% complete
o languages: German 40% complete
o menu: fixed navigation for PPPoE edit


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
