Hi guys,

15.7.10 is here with a larger number of third party updates as
well as a security advisory for FreeBSD.  Otherwise it's relatively
silent as we are still busy reworking the firewall section pages
like we did with OpenVPN and IPSec recently.

We've also bumped the crash reporter into the system section as a
tool to generate custom reports, delivering the shortest possible
path to get in touch with us regarding bugs or other quirks that do
not automatically generate a report.  We are totally happy with the
way you guys have already embraced the reporter and wish to see
even more usage of it.  It has helped us to identify issues and
ship fixes a lot quicker.

Here are the full patch notes:

o src: Multiple integer overflows in expat (libbsdxml) XML parser[1]
o src: bumped tzdata to 2015f[2]
o ports: curl 7.44.0[3], ca_root_nss 3.20, openssh 7.1p1_1[4], sqlite 3.8.11.1[5], phalcon 2.0.7[6], pcre 8.37_4[7]
o crash reporter: create custom reports on demand
o certificates: ca generation issues with recent LibreSSL
o dns resolver: switched to ports-based Unbound (1.5.4) as per FreeBSD handbook
o menu: moved the crash reporter to system category for visibility
o menu: added hot-plugging support for upcoming plugins
o acl: added hot-plugging support for upcoming plugins
o ipsec: fix faulty behaviour on configuration changes
o console: switched halt and reboot numbering
o languages: bring German to 51% completed
o graphs: remove obsolete CPU graph pages


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
