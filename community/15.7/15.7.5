Ladies and Gentlemen,

First of all thanks to everyone who has been using the crash reporter in
the last few days.  It's helped us tremendously in tracking down faulty
code bits that were invisible prior to 15.7.4.  In order to keep the reports
fresh we're hereby pushing out 15.7.5 a bit earlier than usual.

No third-party code will be updated; no reboot necessary.  Here are the
full patch notes:

o menu: fixed expand/collapse behaviour on subpages
o ipsec: fix a bug that prevented using a CARP address
o crash reporter: 200 reports helped to identify and fix 23 unique issues
o crash reporter: add dmesg.boot to files to be submitted


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
