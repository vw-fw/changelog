Good day everyone,

originally, we wanted to make 15.7.14 as boring as possible, but now we are
shipping our major firewall section rework on top of intricate configuration
management fixes instead.  We should also note that the former improved
configuration imports from older systems.  Be sure to let us know when you
find any issues with these changes.

From the third-party and/or security side not much has happened recently.
We are shipping the latest Bind and Squid, for details see the provided links.
Here are the full patch notes:

o config: do not set login auto-complete on factory reset
o config: fix faulty timezone on factory reset
o config: improve config migration path for legacy config imports
o config: new home in system section for the config history and backups
o config: improved the config history differential view
o notable port upgrades: bind 9.10.3[1], squid 3.5.9[2]
o firmware: added Supranet Communications mirror (Middleton, US)
o firewall: reworked rules, schedules, virtual ip, nat and aliases pages
o users: removed special handling of the "all" group
o crash reporter: fixed 9 minor problem reports
o wireless: only advertise supported modes of operation
o system: fix theme selection for user-added themes
o menu: fix expand on all interface edit pages
o ntp: improve service status probing
o diagnostics: fix authentication tester to work in conjunction with translations
o languages: added French translation (33% complete)
o languages: updated German translation (57% complete)


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
