Good day,

It's us.  Again.  Following the recent OpenSSL announcement of CVE-2015-1793
we are pushing out 15.7.2 earlier than expected.  It is notable that FreeBSD
10.1 as well as LibreSSL are not affected.  However, if you are running
Veritawall with OpenSSL you should upgrade immediately.  Services are not
restarted automatically, so a reboot is advised but not mandatory.  Please
take a responsible course of action.

Here are the full patch notes:

o notable ports updates: phalcon 2.0.4[1], libressl 2.2.1[2],
  openssl 1.0.2d[3]
o veritawall-update: can now switch from/to LibreSSL/OpenSSL on the fly
  (needs root shell for now)
o ssh: work around a shutdown bug that prevents other users from logging
  in (requires a reboot if used)
o console: allow the root menu to run one-shot shell commands too
o console: clean up the version advertisement in the banner
o dashboard: colour hostap wifi as green when up
o backup: do not redirect on interface mismatch, reboot right away instead
o system: migrated /var and /tmp memory disks to tmpfs (requires a reboot
  if used)
o proxy: fix the startup when used on a /var memory disk (requires a manual
  start after boot)
o intrusion detection: fix the startup when used on a /var memory disk
  (requires a manual start after boot)
o intrusion detection: enable the uricontent keyword for the ET ruleset


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
