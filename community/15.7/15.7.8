Howdy partners,

While we do hope everyone is enjoying their summer vacation we're rolling
out a larger update due to multiple issues with FreeBSD and third party
programs.  We also have a feature that our community has been yearning for:
the transparent proxy!

This time around, we took extra care with our development version and let
features simmer there until they are fully ready to be rolled out.  We
already have VPN configuration improvements and firmware upgrade eye candy
staged in the current development package.  Join our forum to find out more:
