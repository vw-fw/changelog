Good day everyone,

A regression sneaked into 17.7.9 that updated Lighttpd web server which
made the captive portal incompatible with the newer version.  We are also
bundling OpenSSL updates for both the ports and source.  Last but not
least, Suricata and Hyperscan have been bumped to their latest versions.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: allow user-based language setting through Lobby: Password
o system: allow strict interface binding for OpenSSH
o system: prepare for MVC-based routing pages
o firmware: prepare for production / development release type selection
o firewall: fix a PHP warning when no user rules are installed
o firewall: add refresh button to table diagnostics page
o captive portal: fix chroot regression since lighttpd web server update in 17.7.9
o interfaces: provide a link-local IPv6 when asking for addresses
o intrusion detection: sync port-groups to default template
o ipsec: upgrade vici lib to match strongSwan package
o network time: fix a PHP warning during NMEA deselect
o mvc: do not throw disabled errors in handler
o plugins: os-dyndns 1.4_1 fixes issue with Namecheap error parsing
o plugins: os-freeradius 1.4.0 adds log viewer and fixes users write (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-quagga 1.4.3 adds OSPF firewall rule and spinners for save (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o src: OpenSSL multiple vulnerabilities[1][2]
o ports: hyperscan 4.6.0[3]
o ports: openssl 1.0.2n[4]
o ports: suricata 4.0.3[5]

Two plugin hotfixes have been additionally issued:

o plugins: os-quagga 1.4.3_1 fixes service startup regression
o plugins: os-rfc2136 1.1_1 fixes edit button in IE 11


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
