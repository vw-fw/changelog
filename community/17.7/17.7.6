Dear all,

What a KRACKing week it has been!  In order to move past the WPA2 attacks
we have updated hostapd and wpa_supplicant to their latest version 2.6
including the released security fixes.  If you use wireless devices you
are advised to reboot to properly reload all wireless services.

In more positive news, plugins for Web Proxy SSO support and Siproxd have
been publicly released with this version.  Additionally, multi-remote
OpenVPN client configurations are now easily possible via the GUI.  We
also thank Fabian Abplanalp and HiHo.ch for providing a mirror in Switzerland.
