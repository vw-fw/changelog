Dear friends and followers,

For 3 and a half years now, Veritawall is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

Another 6 months passed by ever so quickly!  The main goal for 18.7 is
stability so we have not yet begun to adopt FreeBSD 11.2, but there are
several Intel NIC driver updates included to bridge the gap until 19.1
comes out.  The upgrade also includes a tremendous amount of IPv6
improvements and authentication framework consolidation.  Please also
take note that QinQ is no longer included in this release.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.

can be found below as well.

As always with our pre-releases, only OpenSSL is provided at this point,
but can be switched for LibreSSL as soon as the release is available.
This release candidate does update directly into the 18.7 stable track
and subsequent release candidates.  Please let us know about your experience!


Stay safe,
