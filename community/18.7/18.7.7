Dear all,

Today we are addressing CVE-2018-18958 regarding an unenforced "deny
config write" privilege.  The issue was reported by brainrecursion this
Monday and subsequently fixed along with several related issues.  The
"deny config write" privilege coupled with admin or user and group manager
rights are affected combinations.  It is an uncommon way to configure
access as the "deny config write" privilege is commonly used for role-based
access to non-system services, e.g. captive portals.

As we cannot be sure that no further issues of this sort exist please
refrain from using the "deny config write" privilege or at least stop
giving access to system services or full admin rights to these users
or groups.  In the midterm we will be looking for replacements of the
current privilege for something that is more generic and robust in
enforcement.

Additionally, the update to Suricata 4.0.6 addresses the SMTP crash
vulnerability CVE-2018-18956.  Since the update does not reboot without
an operating system update please manually restart the intrusion detection
service.
