Hello, hello!

This update addresses an issue with OpenVPN client NAT since 18.1 and a
default gateway disappearance during route reconfiguration.  Assorted
minor UI improvements have been made and both Phalcon and PHP are now on
their latest version.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: avoid default route from disappearing when no manual gateways are set
o firewall: fix outbound NAT for OpenVPN interfaces
o interfaces: multiple overview page improvements (contributed by NOYB)
o firmware: revoke 17.7 update fingerprint
o console: check for root invoke in importer, installer and console menu
o intrusion detection: always show schedule tab
o intrusion detection: log first drop of a flow
o intrusion detection: add a log file viewer
o unbound: add num-queries-per-thread option values for 4096 and 8192
o ui: remove chrome=1 from X-UA-Compatible meta element (contributed by NOYB)
o ui: HTML compliance for attribute "type" on script element (contributed by NOYB)
o ui: HTML compliance for "navigation" "role" on nav element (contributed by NOYB)
o ui: checkbox and radio button label children tweaks (contributed by NOYB)
o ui: break help text on small screens
o ui: use pluggable locations for theme files
o ui: remove table-responsive padding on small screens
o ui: user-scalable viewport (contributed by NOYB)
o mvc: CRUD functions for mutable model controller (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o plugins: os-frr 1.0 with CRUD refactor (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o plugins: os-tor 1.5 with CRUD refactor (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o ports: phalcon 3.3.1
o ports: php 7.1.14

A hotfix release was issued as 18.1.2_2:

o console: do not yet check for root in console menu as it clashes with rc.d
o mvc: fix a typo in the new CRUD getBase() call, currently unused

Stay safe,
