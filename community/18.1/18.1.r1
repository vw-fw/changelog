Hello good folks of the Internet,

For more than 3 years now, Veritawall is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We humbly present to you the sum of another major iteration of the
Veritawall firewall.  Over the second half of 2017 well over 500 changes
have made it into this first release candidate.  Most notably, the
firewall NAT rules have been reworked to be more flexible and usable
via plugins, which is going to pave the way for subsequent API works
on the core firewall functionality.  For more details please find the
attached list of changes below.

Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD[1],
but there is no reliable timeline.  We will keep you up to date through
the usual channels as more news become available.  Hang in there!

Download links, an installation guide[2] and the checksums for the
images can be found below as well.

and subsequent release candidates.  Please let us know about your experience!


Stay safe,
