Dear all,

Today ships Meltdown and Spectre V2 mitigation for amd64, the latter only
effective with the corresponding microcode update.  However, the combating
of speculative execution security issues remains an ongoing quest for the
unforeseeable future.  To avoid surprises HardenedBSD has enabled Meltdown
mitigation (PTI) by default even for AMD CPUs who have not yet been found
vulnerable.  Performance impact is luckily minimal here, although the Spectre
V2 mitigation (IBRS) can slow down CPUs with the respective microcode updates
in place.

To opt out of one or both features, the following values can now be
persistently set under System: Settings: Tunables:

o Disable PTI via "vm.pmap.pti" to "0" and a reboot, and
o Disable IBRS via "hw.ibrs_disable" to "1" with a simple "Apply".

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: optional prefix Google Drive backups with host and domain name
o system: also render tunables in loader.conf to obsolete loader.conf.local editing
o interfaces: allow /127, /128 and /32 static IP address configurations everywhere
o interfaces: improve logging and assorted cleanups (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o interfaces: ignore dynamic linkup events for unassigned interfaces
o interfaces: hide previously assigned interfaces from bridges
o interfaces: allow all IPv6 prefixes from 48 to 64 for DHCPv6 mode
o firewall: add VIP gateway option for PPPoE interfaces
o firewall: add update interval option to log widget (contributed by NOYB)
o firewall: respect mask in traffic shaper queue config (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o firmware: fix veritawall-code for src.git and ABI probing
o firmware: fix veritawall-patch file permission apply for plugins
o intrusion detection: support request headers in ruleset metadata
o openvpn: switch status to version 3 to avoid wrong parsing of commas
o openvpn: parse all states to retrieve all relevant connection status info
o captive portal: exclude "I" from simplified voucher character set for clarity
o plugins: os-lldpd 1.1 adds interface selection (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-monit 1.6 fixes file path validation (contributed by Frank Brendel)
o plugins: os-postfix 1.1 adds smart host and SMTP authentication (contributed by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-tinc 1.3 corrects host port usage (contributed by DasTestament)
o plugins: os-tor 1.6 adds IPv6 and exit settings (contributed by Gijs Peskens)
o ui: update tokenizer to 2.6, visual tweaks and blur-add
o ui: buttons for services control in MVC (contributed by Smart-Soft)
o src: reinitialize IP header length after checksum calculation[1]
o src: fix IPsec validation and use-after-free[2]
o src: update timezone database information[3]
o src: update file(1) to new version with security update[4]
o src: add mitigations for two classes of speculative execution vulnerabilities on amd64[5]
o ports: ca_root_nss 3.36
o ports: curl 7.59.0[6]
o ports: igmpproxy 0.2.1[7]
o ports: lighttpd 1.4.49[8]
o ports: openvpn 2.4.5[9]
o ports: phalcon 3.3.2[10]
o ports: php 7.1.15[11]
o ports: strongswan 5.6.2 fix for public key authentication[12]


Stay safe,
