Hi there,

OpenVPN released version 2.4.2 and also 2.3.15 which come with two high
profile fixes addressing CVE-2017-7479 and CVE-2017-7478.  While we still
aim for OpenVPN 2.4 adoption during the 17.1 series, we have deferred
updating the release version from 2.3 to 2.4 at this point to be able
to respond more quickly.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: fix gateway failover edge cases missed in 17.1.6
o system: fix default route display in diagnostics page
o system: consistent precision display in gateway monitoring loss and RTT
o system: correctly restart cron via backend call

o system: keep WAN DHCPv6 configuration option on console port reassign
o system: unify the console yes/no prompts to indicate their default behaviour
o system: separate row and unhide button for 2FA OTP QR code display
o system: prevent stripping of migrated configuration during factory reset
o firmware: veritawall-bootstrap bare-mode addition for installing repository metadata only
o firmware: veritawall-bootstrap will never be deleted in case it is required for recovery
o firmware: veritawall-revert now always properly reverts the core package
o firmware: fix argument parsing in all update and development utilities
o firewall: do not save range when end port is empty
o firewall: do not automatically reload filter after alias delete
o firewall: skip well-known ports for ranges
o firewall: fetching bogon files should not use fetch internal auto-retry

o interfaces: avoid potential configure loops in IPv4 renewal
