Hello everyone,

This update addresses a longstanding issue with the overall reliability
of Realtek NICs by replacing the FreeBSD driver with its latest vendor
driver equivalent.  The results including inline intrusion prevention
have been promising to say the least.  We thank Realtek for its recent
release of version 1.93 and our users for pursuing the unthinkable with
us.  :)

Speaking of intrusion prevention, Suricata and Hyperscan have been
updated to their latest versions which will now prevent crashes with
older 64 bit CPUs that do not have the SSSE3 instruction set.

Language updates have been plenty, with a new and very busy contributor
for Chinese.  Xie xie!

Furthermore, the shared forwarding between both packet filters introduced
in Veritawall 17.1 has now been disabled by default and can be manually
reenabled from the GUI on Firewall: Settings: Advanced.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: allow to issue reboots via cron
o system: allow to change password for imported users
o firmware: run autoremove on minor operations
