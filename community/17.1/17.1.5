Hi all,

After a brief timeout due to a super happy image release, 17.1.5 brings to
you several longterm improvements for the firewall handling, dynamic DNS
and several plugin updates, with Quagga and Monit as two brand new additions
to the pool.  As an especially longterm improvement, the German translation
finally hit 100% completed thanks to the many contributors over the last
two years.

We are currently working on extending SafeStack support to mission-critical
third-party packages, testing the move to PHP 7.1 and finishing the
associated roadmap for the upcoming 17.7 release.  Stay tuned for more.
