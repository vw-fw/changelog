Hello,

Please do enjoy this round of timely crypto library updates and
other reliability fixes.

Work has so far been focused on the firmware update process to ensure
its safety around edge cases and recovery methods for the worst case.
To that end 21.1.3 will likely receive the full revamp including API and
GUI changes for a swift transition after thorough testing of the changes
now available in the development package of this release.
