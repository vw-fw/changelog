Good day everyone,

This is mainly a security and reliablility update.  There are several FreeBSD
security advisories and updates for third party tools such as curl.

The historic bsdinstaller has been replaced by a scriptable alternative
based on the readily available bsdinstall bundled with the base system.
And, yes, this brings ZFS installer support into the upcoming 21.7 release.

On the development side the migration to Phalcon 4 framework is now underway
and brings improved UI/API responsiveness.  One of the remaining road map
goals is the migration to PHP 7.4 which can be carried out after said
framework update is complete and released.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: return authentication errors for RADIUS also
