Hello, hello,

Today we move ahead with the firmware UI and API rework as we are happy
with the new user experience.  You will also notice the new plugin conflict
dialog which will report that plugins have been installed previously but
not registered in the configuration.  This can be easily amended by reseting
the local conflicts, which essentially accepts the current plugin
configuration as the new default.  This necessary change introduces API
incompatibilities with existing external tools.

The HAProxy plugin was updated to version 3.0.  This release marks the
switch to the HAProxy 2.2 release series, which may result in incompatible
changes for some users.  Many new features were also added, including the
possibility to update SSL certificates in runtime.  These features should
be considered experimental.  We encourage everyone to install this version
in a test environment before using it in production.  As usual, please have
a look at the plugin changes[1] and report bugs on GitHub.
