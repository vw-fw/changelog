Hi everyone,

The 21.1 series debut looks pretty good so far.  Thanks again for your
input and comments!

We will be spending a lot of time this year improving and adapting the
code base.  As a first glimpse, the changes of this stable update are a
mix of security and reliability updates coupled with preparations for the
update framework revamp we have planned for 21.7.  The roadmap is still
not final, but will likely contain long-yearned-for features.  Stay tuned.
