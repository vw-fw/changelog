Hi everyone,

The release schedule is being stretched bit by bit to see how long we
can go without an update.  Well, we did not want wait any longer to
share with you the following bits... so here they are.  ;)

FreeBSD incorporated several reliability fixes for Hyper-V and we had
to back out an ICMP stable commit that was not fully working for trace
route output over the network.  There are several important ports
updates, namely Lighttpd, Strongswan and OpenSSH all brought to their
latest versions.

On our side, multi-point VPN plugins have been corrected to properly
group to their respective firewall rule interface.  For anyone waiting
to migrate their VPNs from 16.1.20 to 16.7, now is the time to do so!
Also, the stale OpenVPN windows binaries have been removed.  Note that
we gracefully support configuration file export in several formats.
