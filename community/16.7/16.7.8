Ladies and gentlemen!

Today we present to you the latest stable iteration of the 16.7
series focusing on improved reliability and security in all areas
and major feature upgrades.

Big news this week are the inclusion of two new fully-featured
plugins for Tinc VPN and FTP proxying, the latter being kindly
sponsored by EURO-LOG AG[1].  Together with the community we are
continuing the trend towards a comprehensive plugins environment
based on top of our distinctive MVC GUI framework, with more plugins
already in direct development.

Speaking of such, the MVC framework received fine-grained versioning
and constraint support as well as a completely revamped API error
handling and plugin-compatible authentication handling.

Last but not least, enclosed within are third-party software updates,
most importantly the latest versions of LibreSSL, Bind, Sudo, OpenVPN,
Suricata, PHP and Curl.

A reboot is not strictly necessary, but recommended.
