Hi there,

Another small reliability update with additional RADIUS user creation
support included.  23.1 is just around the corner now and most work
for it has already been done.  The major release is scheduled for
January 26 with a release candidate coming out 2 weeks earlier.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add group (class) sync and user creation for RADIUS authentication
o system: show and search ACL endpoints in privilege selector
o system: replace a number of log_error() calls with log_msg() equivalent
o system: improve SSH lockout behaviour
o firewall: sates page performance improvements and better address parsing in search
o firewall: reuse "hostid" on filter reload events
o ipsec: allow to search all phase 2 entries via API call
o openvpn: remove unused "pool_enable" attribute
o unbound: introduce blocklist module changes for upcoming 23.1
o unbound: fix log message blocklist item count (contributed by kulikov-a)
o unbound: also change working dir for unbound-checkconf in start script (contributed by kulikov-a)
o ui: unicode content for tokenizer (contributed by kulikov-a)
o plugins: os-clamav 1.8[1]
o plugins: os-ddclient IPv6 parsing fix[2]
o plugins: os-rfc2136 1.7 fixes key format issue with latest bind-tools update
o plugins: os-theme-cicada 1.31 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-theme-vicuna 1.43 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-wireguard post-start hook improvement for interface grouping
o ports: curl 7.86.0[3]
o ports: dnsmasq 2.88[4]
o ports: nss 3.86[5]
o ports: phalcon 5.1.2[6]
o ports: phpseclib 3.0.18[7]
o ports: python 3.9.16[8]

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.10_2:

o ipsec: default log should be set to "basic" but PHP 8 disagreed
o unbound: fix missing query_reply property leading to an AttributeError


Stay safe and happy holidays,
