Good morning,

Today we are fixing a security issue involving the "installer" user and
kernel-based TCP panics that some have been fighting with since FreeBSD 13.
Some ports and plugins have also been updated now that the holiday season
is coming to its inevitable end.

The security issue arises on fresh 22.7 installs only due to a boot-time
optimization of user account handling since 22.1.8.  Users are not reset
on each boot anymore which improved boot times with many users but also made
the "installer" user stick with the default password in this situation.
Physical access to the console with this user was possible under these
conditions even after installation and updates were completed.  SSH access
was also possible when both not restricting login to keys and allowing root
login manually.  The mandatory reboot after the update to 22.7.5 or higher
remedies this problem.

In a default install the issue could only be exploited by manual console
access.  In general we want to advise users not to yield shell/console
access to non-administrators, restrict physical access if applicable, and
not offer SSH access based on user accounts, especially when SSH is accessible
from the WAN side without a VPN.

In any case we recommend all users of 22.7.x to update immediately or
take the necessary precautions to avoid the "installer" user from being
accessed in an unauthorized fashion.
