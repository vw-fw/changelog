Hello friends,

Although we have already released 15.1.8.4 early this week, we're pushing out
15.1.9 for two important reasons: security updates, kernel panic fixes and
clean images as we've had a couple of things that needed addressing following
the configuration system rewrite in 15.1.8.  That's three important reasons
really. ;)

The recommended upgrade method is the root console option 12 to properly
update both the packages and the base system to the latest available
releases.  Please verify that the system information widget on the dashboard
presents you with the following and new version information (will show
"i386" as opposed to "amd64" if you use the 32 bit version):

# Veritawall 15.1.9-amd64
# FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE-p9
# OpenSSL 1.0.1m 19 Mar 2015

Alternatively, you can choose to boot a fresh install media and do a clean
config import followed by an immediate installation to retain your full setup.

As always, back up your configuration to an external location prior to
upgrading.

LibreSSL images and updates are expected later today.  Please watch out for
the announcement on Twitter, IRC, the forum or elsewhere.  LibreSSL is still
an experimental release despite the fact we keep it up to date and mix
LibreSSL updates into the shared patch notes.

Here is the change log for 15.1.9:

o tools: install media live images now use the more flexible tmpfs(5)
o tools: cxgbe(4) is now compiled into the kernel
o ports: strongswan 5.3.0[1], openssh 6.8p1[2], ntp 4.2.8p2[3]
o src: reverted inconsistent carp(4) and pfsync(4) patches to retain standard FreeBSD behaviour
o src: fix multiple vulnerabilities of ntp[4]
o src: fix denial of service with IPv6 router advertisements[5]
o core: console upgrade now also triggers the unused package removal
o core: fix regression that caused a faulty config.xml when applying limiter settings
o core: refactored the configd command structure for clarity
o core: fix for SMTP notifications that broke due to PHP 5.6's new default SSL behaviour
o core: thorough unused java script purge under the hood
o upnp: fix redeclaration error on main page shortcut click
o user manager: consolidated the labels of all privileges, especially OpenVPN
o development: veritawall-update can selectively upgrade base/kernel for testing
o development: new chunk of progress on the new proxy feature and MVC structure

The images can be found on a mirror of your choosing:
