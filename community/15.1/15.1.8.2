Hello friends,

After an extended low profile period we are back in business with the latest
and greatest 15.1.8.  You'll notice that we have incorporated the recent
OpenSSL security advisories along with a larger number of fixes and cleanups.
But there's more.  We have pushed the bulk load of our new configuration
handling code which is intended to bridge the gap between the old and the
new front-end code.  And since we don't like to stop there just yet, we've
also added support for backing up your configs on your private Google Drive.

We encourage our users running 15.1.7.1 or later to try the root console menu
option "12" for a fully automatic system upgrade.  Otherwise, it's either
installing from scratch using install media and the installer's config import
feature, or running the GUI firmware update and dropping to a root shell to
run `veritawall-update && reboot' to fully benefit from the base system
security updates.  Please let us know about your upgrade experience.  We are
still adding and tweaking code to complement and simplify the upgrade process.

Users of the install media are encouraged to update their firmware via the GUI
from 15.1.8 to 15.1.8.2 as soon as possible due to a few important config
system hotfixes.

Here is the full list of changes:

o src: applied FreeBSD-SA-15:06.openssl[1]
o src: updated to tzdata2015b[2]
o src: add missing max-packets parsing for pf(4)
o src: Veritawall branding for boot loader
o bsdinstaller: speed up SD card writes using async mode and assorted cleanups
o veritawall-update: don't trigger a spurious update after a fresh install when
  invoked for the first time
o notable port updates: isc-dhcp42 4.2.8, libressl 2.1.6 (hopefully builds
  will be available on Friday), openssl 1.0.1m, ca_root_nss 3.18
o core: removed obsolete conf_mount_ro() and conf_mount_rw() usage
o core: removed platform awareness with a more appropriate probe for install
  media
o core: removed all remnants of the old firmware update code
o core: completely rewrote the config.xml handling to unify old and new GUI
  components
o core: added support for config backup to Google Drive[3]
o core: fixed a few config handling issues with the new system via 15.1.8.1
o core: fixed missing aliases in new config system via 15.1.8.2
o core: removed php-fpm remnants that would e.g. prevent automatic IP
  assignment in DHCP mode via 15.1.8.2
o packages: removed the legacy package system
o upnp: transformed the preinstalled package into a standard feature
o openvpn: added the client export package as a standard feature
o dyndns: minor follow-ups for Duck DNS support
o firewall log: fix bug that would prevent the filter from working correctly
o ntp: added numerous config form tweaks and fixed daemon startup
o igmpproxy: fixed daemon startup
o dns: properly regenerate hosts file on reload
o ssh: fix sshd reload on save in system admin access page
o src: avoid invoke of FreeBSD's rc system on halt and reboot
o dhcp: improve compatibility with IPv6 deployments
