Hello everyone,

QUICK UPDATE: A regression sneaked into the release that renders the console
unusable when "System: Advanced: Admin Access: Console menu protection" is
being disabled.  As far as we can see, this does not effect anything but the
console login so you should be able to log back in and recheck the option to
get it back (even though you will have to type the username/password).

What an intense week.  The m0n0wall EoL announcement[1] leaves us with a long
TODO list that goes as far as realigning the project, especially in terms of
lowering hardware requirements.  We're slowly getting there, but it has only
been a week for us compared to m0n0wall's 12 year track record.  We ask for a
little more time and for you to keep discussing challenges and opportunities
through the available communication channels.

Speaking of track records, today we bring you 15.1.6.1, the extra one meaning
we've caught 3 issues during the release process tests and had to essentially
redo the whole thing. No idea if we keep this numbering trick or not, consider
it a little experiment.

The highlights (TL;DR): We now run FreeBSD 10.1 with lots of driver updates
and security patches on top, addressed two CVEs, introduce our base upgrade
tool veritawall-update, new naming scheme for install images and IKEv1 for IPsec.

Acquiring the release:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/veritawall/files/15.1.6.1/

Explaining the naming scheme:

o cdrom: ISO installer image with live system capabilities running in
  VGA-only mode
o vga: USB installer image with live system capabilities running in
  VGA-only mode
o serial: USB installer image with live system capabilities running in
  serial console (115200) mode with secondary VGA support (no kernel
  messages there though)

Explaining (experimental) base upgrades:

The preferred method for upgrades is still booting install media, importing
the config through the installer and reinstalling as it is a clean fallback.
Nevertheless, we've pushed a new tool that can be invoked manually on the
command line after the firmware upgrade to 15.1.6.1 has been completed.

To upgrade the base system, as root type

# veritawall-update
# reboot

The immediate reboot is mandatory, but you are in charge.  Again, this is
still experimental, so please report any bugs or strange behaviour running
an older release that has been upgraded in this way.  If all hell breaks
loose, the config can still be recovered using the preferred upgrade method
even when the system is broken during the upgrade.  And you should always
keep a backup of your config somewhere else...

Change Log 15.1.6:

o Migrated FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE-p5 plus required custom patches
o Two additional kernel security fixes (thanks to Oliver Pinter/HardenedBSD)
o New naming scheme for installer images: cdrom, serial, vga
o New veritawall-update tool for base system upgrades
o Notable port updates: pkg 1.4.12, bind 9.9.6-P2[2] (CVE-2015-1349),
  php 5.6.6[3] (CVE-2015-0273), syslogd 10.1
o Fixed wizard default settings and reload/redirect
o DNS forwarder now properly reloads on host overrides updates
o IPFW ruleset reload fix after start/restart of captive portal
o Page contents upload and MIME type for svg images fix in captive portal
o IPsec/Strongswan now supports IKEv1
o Basic plumbing for the MVC framework has been completed
o Fix Copy my MAC address in DHCP service editor
o Removed IPv6 fcgi-fpm leftovers
o Assorted fixes regarding menus, page titles and links

Change Log 15.1.6.1:

o Don't clobber user and group settings when running veritawall-update.
  Caused e.g. dhcpd to refuse operation.
o Fix a regression that would prevent e.g. sshd from starting.
o Install veritawall-update by default.

Stay safe,
The Veritawall team
