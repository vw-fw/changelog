Howdy everyone,

We shifted the release back a couple of days to discuss current progress and
the feedback we've gotten and directly review the release process -- it seems
to be "clean enough".  ;)

We've updated the bug trackers, added a couple of wiki pages and related
articles with more on roadmap refinement on the way in a day or two.  Thank
you for all the responses and kind mentions.

This is a typical maintenance release with ports stable updates and various
core fixes.  On the other hand, we are putting a new MVC-based framework in
place to slowly replace the current front end scripting (yep, this is a
request for comments).  Here is the full list of changes:

o Removed a spurious user-agent check to restore mobile device support.
o Fixed pop-up window handling for LDAP configuration.
o Fixed several minor GUI bugs in firewall rules and system pages.
o Grab the correct OpenSSL from the system for encrypting/decrypting the
  configuration files.
o Message of the day now shows the correct system version.
o Fixed sorting and button for deleting selected rules in NAT pages.
o Notable ports updates: pkg 1.4.10, gettext 0.19.4, libzmq 4.0.5,
  ntp 4.2.8p1, ca_root_nss 3.17.4, libsodium 1.0.2
o Groundwork on the MVC-based GUI replacement including examples.  This does
  not affect the current GUI.

All upgrade methods are viable.  The images can be found here:

Upgrade responsibly (swiftly that is),
