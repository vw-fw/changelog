Hi everyone,

Another week, another stable release.  :) While we are busy working on
extensive kernel cleanups to bring Veritawall closer to FreeBSD, we decided
to ship a minor update today with a number of third-party software refreshes
and assorted fixes across the board before we make the leap to 15.1.10.

We'd like to mention the extensive translation groundwork being done by
Isaac Levy, which will enable others to start working on specific language
support now that there's an official English translation in the system.  A
Japanese translation is being discussed already -- if you'd like to contribute
other language translations let us know through the usual channels.  We'd be
more than happy to include them into a future release.

Here is the full change log of 15.1.9.2:

o captive portal: fixed rule generation on empty IP
o gui: print current user in upper right corner along with the hostname
o user manager: fixed empty password error when creating a new user
o high availability: don't trigger sync when not configured
o interfaces: added the hn(4) interfaces as ALTQ capable
o configuration: do not overwrite the default configuration on firmware
  updates
o ipsec: fixed road warrior authentication
o openvpn: fixed client edit link
o ports: sqlite 3.8.9[1]
o ports: strongswan fix for xauth (road warrior-related)
o ports: PHP 5.6.8[2]
o ports: pkg 1.5.1[3]
o development: kickstarted language support via English
  translation (.pot file)
o development: further progress on the proxy feature/MVC framework
o development: improved the live mount to propagate the mounted version
  into the dashboard

The update is not available via install media, but you can just as well
download 15.1.9 from a mirror and upgrade with a few simple clicks:

Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
