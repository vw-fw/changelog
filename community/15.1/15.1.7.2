Hello again,

This week has been really quiet just like last week so we give you another
tiny stable update in the style of "click-click-click-done".  Most notably,
we've tracked down two issues with the package database being unavailable,
resulting in "no updates available" situations.  Thanks again to everyone
who helped to debug and test this with us!

We are not aware of any security issues at this point.  Our LibreSSL efforts
continue with 15.1.7.2-LibreSSL later today and it seems to be an extended
work in progress as we uncover just how deep OpenSSL is tied into the FreeBSD
ecosystem.  Needless to say it shouldn't be this way, but we're getting there
step by step.

For everybody running 15.1.7.1 that might be a good opportunity to try the
root console menu option 12 to update in one single go (including available
base updates).  It can also be invoked via SSH if you are into that sort of
headless/remote workflow.

Here is the full list of changes:

o bsdinstaller: fixed the package database wipe on custom install
o bsdinstaller: install progress bar is now more responsive with regard to
  individual directories in /usr
o firmware: removed obsoleted upgrade code and tools following our
  pkgng/veritawall-update approach
o miniupnpd: now properly links to the OpenSSL/LibreSSL port
o ipmitool: now properly links to the OpenSSL/LibreSSL port
o core: extensive cleanups for PHP shebang usage, wiped numerous unused
  scripts and unreachable web pages, removed PBI remnants, removed 'tmp_path'
  softcoding to improve readability and git-grep(1) experience, removed stale
  debug statement that were only marginally useful while bumping the
  statements to default that indicate real errors
o console: fixed halt script permissions and switched to synchronous mode
o sysctl: added net.inet6.ip6.rfc6204w3 to improve the DHCPv6 experience
o nat: remove target IP hardcoding in automatic rules (props to pfSense for
  pointing that out to us)
o rc: fixed missing package database when using the MFS option for /var
o configd: added a standard rc.d script for easy daemon control
o mvc: a lot of new code to support general infrastructure for upcoming
  porting of features, e.g. proxy feature
o help: adjusted links in the help menu to use HTTPS and improved targeting

If you are new to Veritawall, the 15.1.7 images can be found here and are easily
updated through the GUI after installation:

Stay safe,
