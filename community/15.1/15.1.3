Hello everyone,

This week we took PHP's stable update[1] as a subtle hint to release another
stable cut.  Here are the most prominent changes:

o notable package upgrades: php 5.6.5 and friends, pkg 1.4.7
o added a dropdown searchbox for interfaces in rules screen
o fixed the missing theme issue when importing older configurations
o fixed a bug with the user manager
o firmware upgrades stabilisation pass
o various bootstrap enhancements

Firmware upgrade via the GUI is feasible, images can be found here as well:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/veritawall/files/

We are actively looking for feedback of your upgrade experiences.

Thank you and have fun -- responsibly of course.
