Dear friends and followers,

We are happy to announce Veritawall 15.1.10.2 today following a rather
exciting firmware upgrade bug that prevented the release yesterday.
We are back to normal now thanks to the wonderful people of pkgng, and,
boy, do we have news to share.

First and foremost, it's time to reveal to all of you the Proxy Server
(based on squid) work we've done under the hood for a few months now.
The new MVC framework has been plugged seamlessly into the GUI and can
be inspected under "Services: Proxy Server".  This is a sneak preview of
things to come and any help in testing and commenting on the feature is
going to be a huge help as we go forward.

The translation project has been kickstarted for Japanese[1] and Chinese,
although the translations are not yet available in the GUI due to their
incompleteness.  We do, however, think this is a good opportunity to ask
for contributions to the translations and welcome efforts for other
languages as well.

Last but not least HardenedBSD's work[2] to build Veritawall on top of their
code has been a quick success story and will eventually bring features like
ASLR into the project.  The cooperation also sparked a number of build tools
improvements that will make maintaining the project easier in the future.
Changes also help to unify the OpenSSL/LibreSSL release handling so that
with this announcement you will be enjoying your timely LibreSSL firmware
upgrade.  ;)

Here is the full list of changes:

o proxy: basic proxy features on top of our new and shiny MVC framework
  under "Services: Proxy Server"
o proxy: smart tokens for item lists (copy/paste CSV list into them and
  watch the magic happen)
o proxy: help on/off per item or full page
o proxy: hide advanced options and include sane defaults
o proxy: FTP proxy included with same ACL controls as HTTP
o proxy: simple authentication using built-in user database
o openvpn: added Tunnelblick's version of the OpenVPN XOR feature for
  protocol obfuscation[3]
o core: fixed config.xml section import regression
o core: stripped numerous dynamic strings from gettext() invokes
o ports: added FreeBSD's 10.1 ifinfo tool to probe for interface statistics
  to replace legacy PHP module code
o ports: bsdinstaller 2.3 no longer uses cpdup utility, plus log collection
  and SONAME fixes
o ports: updated to pkg 1.5.2, phalcon 2.0.0, dnsmasq 2.72_1[4]
o ports: Perl is now installed by default (5.18)
o development: OpenSSL and LibreSSL branches have been merged for a simpler
  build experience and smaller release times
o development: the package sets are now always kept as a single archive that
  can be reused and recompiled (even selectively)
o development: stable translation template file is available now[5]
o development: kickstarted Japanese and Chinese translations
o development: language translation files are now automatically compiled
  into the core package
o development: added a persistent build config file for setting the version,
  crypto flavour and release version tag (if applicable)

The update is available via the firmware upgrade feature only.


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
