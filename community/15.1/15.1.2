Hi folks,

Some of you have been wondering; now wonder no more: the next stable release
is here.  From the changelog:

o firmware upgrade experience improvements
o FreeBSD SA-15:01 with multiple OpenSSL fixes
o OpenSSL from ports now brings you the latest and greatest 1.0.1l
o pkg 1.4.6 hot off the press

The images can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/veritawall/files/

This is mostly motivated by the latest OpenSSL issues, although I must say we
work on giving LibreSSL a chance soon and make a final decision about the
library that we are going to stick to from 15.7 on.  Any help here is
appreciated. :)

Recommended ways of upgrade:

Upgrade via the GUI, make sure you restart the box so that no service will
run on vulnerable binaries.  The base OpenSSL will *not* be updated at this
point, so if you don't fully trust the port just yet try the second method.

Or:

Take your favourite image, boot up the device or VM with the new install
image.  In the installer, choose "Import Configuration" and if all is well,
continue with the Easy/Quick install.  This way makes sure all of the base
system is replaced.
