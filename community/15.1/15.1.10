Dear all,

The new release is finally here!  Yet before we begin, we'd like to stress
this part: please read the notes enclosed; they are important for the future
of Veritawall.

We are now about two thirds into what is going to be 15.7.  On this path,
we've always released cutting edge snapshot releases and 15.1.10 is no
different.  However, what is different is the fact that this release marks
a larger departure from what is considered a mere fork: we are leaving
behind numerous kernel patches and two major features to better align with
FreeBSD's code base and to rebuild these features on more maintainable
fundament.  In this case we're talking about the layer 7 shaper and
FAIRQ/CODEL support.

But we not only delete all the things.  No, we have added NanoBSD images to
the release bundle.  Reengineered the process to keep completely in sync with
the FreeBSD ports collection.  Replaced the GUI menu and ACL with MVC-based
rewrites.  We've switched on the fingerprint verification to finally enforce
the (previously introduced) package repository signing.

It's very likely that most of these additions and removals are not visible
from a usage perspective and we do believe that is a good thing.  For some
these changes will spark criticism, but then again they are a chance to
better distinguish between projects and individual requirements.  We believe
in choice.  We believe in the choices we make for the benefit of our users.
And we intend to keep it that way for a long time.  Talk to us and let us
know what we can achieve together.  :)

Important notes on the live upgrade:

The recommended way to upgrade is the root shell menu option "12".  The box
will require an immediate reboot.  No further steps will be necessary.

The GUI firmware upgrade has never been perfect due to wanting to upgrade
itself through running the update.  The GUI update is still safe to run, but
it will not let you know when it is finished.  The update window will go
blank, which is your queue to refresh the page.  The login window will
reappear.  After login, the GUI update will already be finished.  To wrap
up the full upgrade cycle, drop to the root shell and type:

# veritawall-update && reboot

But then again, simply use the root shell menu option "12".  It works
seamlessly via SSH, too.

The full change log of 15.1.10 is as follows:

o kernel: cleaned up the custom legacy patches to move the underlying
  FreeBSD back to more standard behaviour
o kernel: removed dysfunctional dummynet patches and traffic shaper / limiter
  GUI feature (ETA for a replacement is 15.7)
o kernel: stripped FAIRQ and CODELQ disciplines as they are no longer
  supported by FreeBSD
o kernel: isolated MPD (Multi-link PPP daemon) alteration patches
  (will be dropped in a future release)
o kernel: fixed IPSec dropping connections in some scenarios
o images: a new NanoBSD-based image has been added to the release
  bundle (directly written to SD or HD)
o notable ports updates: curl 7.42.1, ca_root_nss 3.18.1
o installer: omit swap and add noatime to root partition in quick/easy
  install when available space is under 30GB, fixed faulty exit on
  importer cancel
o development: the ports tree is now kept fully in sync with FreeBSD
o development: improved the ports build script in terms of error reporting
  and rebuilding speed
o development: simplified file system path handling in most files to make
  the code easier to maintain
o development: fixed a bug that prevented extracting our packages on ZFS
o core: replaced most of the legacy PHP module usage with more portable
  (and maintainable) scripting code
o dashboard: fixed the main link to always land on the dashboard to not
  confuse a restricted ACL setup
o traffic shaper: layer 7 filter removed as the project has been abandoned
  (ETA for a replacement is 16.1)
o system/settings: added an FTP proxy feature for clients trying to do
  active transfers
o menu: replaced the old one with the new MVC equivalent plus assorted
  improvements
o ACL: replaced the old one with the new MVC equivalent
o login: polished the login screen behaviour
o backend: don't try to send a signal to non-existing process
o user: can now change the password via "User: Change Password" from the menu
o firmware: enforce signed packages on upgrade for our mirrors
o rrd: fixed directory create-after-use
