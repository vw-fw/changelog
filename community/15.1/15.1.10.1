Hi everyone,

Here comes a quick hotfix for a pressing VLAN regression we've been hearing
about today plus 3 more minor additions.  These are the patch notes:

o interfaces: fix interface rename regression that prevented VLANs from
  being set up
o firmware: clean up downloaded packages after installation
o logging: prevent spurious pgrep-related messages from being logged
o config: fix Google Drive backup accounting off-by-two

The update available via the GUI or console firmware upgrade.  No restarts
necessary, except for those being affected by the VLAN regression.  Let us
know whether this brings you back to normal.

Both LibreSSL and OpenSSL are available as of now!


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
