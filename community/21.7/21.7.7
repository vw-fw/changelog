Hi folks,

End-of-the-year security and reliability update coming right up!

Due to inconclusive reports we are disabling the Netmap API version 14
support in Suricata to get a better understanding of the situation.
The plan still is to keep it for the 22.1 upgrade and it has in fact been
enabled on the development versions since September without any obvious
issues.

The upgrade to 22.1-BETA3 is also included in the bundled development version.
