Hi guys,

Time for a quick update!  We are still polishing our non-MVC GUI pages
to match the modern style of the MVC equivalents and fix a few minor
bugs along the way.  In these matters, we ask for your participation in
critically reviewing the changes below in order to catch remaining
issues as soon as possible.  We expect to finish our full code sweep
next week.  After that we will shift focus to work on new features.

The upgrades from 15.7.25 to 16.1.x briefly stalled with 16.1.6 due to
a dormant incompatibility in the FreeBSD package management tool after
flipping from 10.1 to 10.2, so we went ahead and made it all better.
More precaution in our own update tools will hopefully prevent such
unwanted breakage in the future, but we understand that these things
can slip through. :)

New images are on the way shortly after 16.1.8.  We are also introducing
the new "veritawall-stable" firmware path and some cool upgrade features
for our brave testers.  More explanations will follow soon.

Here are the full patch notes:

o ports: pecl-radius 1.3.0[1], bind 9.10.3-P4[2], bsnmp-ucd 0.4.2[3], openssh 7.2p2[4], sqlite 3.11.1[5]
o captive portal: add session timeout to status info
o firewall: fix non-report of errors when filter reload errors could not be parsed
o pppoe server: make service control buttons work with multiple instances

o firmware: fix an overzealous upgrade run when the package tool only changes options

o network time: reworked pages for a polished look and feel
o system: removed NTP settings from general settings
o snmp: refactored page for a polished look and feel
o access: let only root access status.php as it leaks too much info
o development: remove the automount features
o development: added in-place package upgrades using the upstream repository
o development: addition of "veritawall-stable" package on our way to nightly builds
o development: veritawall-update can now install locally available base and kernel sets


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
