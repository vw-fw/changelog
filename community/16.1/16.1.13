Dear all,

Ever so swiftly we are adopting the OpenSSL and LibreSSL updates
and welcome the cooperation between both projects on this one.
Way to go guys!

In other news, NTP and Bind were updated to their latest versions.
The gateway monitoring tool Apinger can now properly handle NTP
taking over time from time to time.  Er, anyway, language packs
will become pluggable in the long run and the MVC work for the
HAProxy plugin is now completely bundled with the release.  Plugin
release is currently scheduled for 16.1.14.

Here is the full change log for 16.1.13:

  libressl 2.2.7[4], openssl 1.0.2h[5]
o languages: newly packaged translations with latest updates

  NTP operation

  time when unavailable
