Hi guys,

Today we are following up on the OpenSSL advisories.  LibreSSL was not
affected (surprise, surprise), but received a tiny fix to sync up with
the deprecation of the high-severity SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option of its
sibling.

In other news, we are shipping a few minor fixes along with all-new
SSL-centric rulesets for the intrusion prevention courtesy of abuse.ch[3].
Protect your assets, they are worth it!

Without fuzz, here are the full patch notes:

o ports: libressl 2.2.6[1], openssl 1.0.2f[2]
o intrusion prevention: add SSL fingerprint blacklist and other abuse lists
  (courtesy of abuse.ch[3])
o captive portal: limit the max vouchers per call
o captive portal: change voucher download filename to match group name
o captive portal: strip bad characters from group name
o captive portal: fix multiple voucher generation
o firewall: add rule categorisation tag field
o search: tweak padding to align with right visual boarder
o console: fix halt script to show product name again
o firmware: revoked the old 15.7 update fingerprint
o interfaces: fix VLAN edit page to show the correct page name
o squid: fix authentication script permission regression
o dashboard: remove non-authoriative hardware crypto probing
o system: do not accept an authentication server with an empty name
o system: added hint that device polling setting needs reboot
  (contributed by Olivier Paroz)
o system: assorted translation fixes (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o logging: unhide IGMP packets from firewall log view
  (contributed by Isaac Levy)


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
