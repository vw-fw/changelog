Hi all,

It is time for a last full stable release before we offer our
16.1.20 end-of-life version, which then can be used to upgrade
to the 16.7 series.

Most changes presented today were either long-running development
additions for 16.7 or small reports that came up during the 16.7-RC
testing period.  Another prominent fix addresses an issue with
sporadic premature captive portal authentication timeouts that
one of our awesome forum members helped to debug.

Here are the full patch notes:

o ports: suricata 3.0.2[1], squid 3.5.20[1], expat 2.2.0[3],
  haproxy 1.6.7[4], bind 9.10.4-P2[5]
o firewall: hide previously selected nested aliases from the
  autocompletion on alias edit
o firewall: fix log view to properly render all of its html
o firewall: fix link to IPv6 disable setting on rules screen
o firewall: remove CARP restriction of matching interface subnet
o interfaces: fix IPv6 subnet bits count on interface status
o interfaces: traffic graphs now show more device types
o gateways: prevent spurious dynamic default gateways from showing up
o gateways: change the creation order of dynamic gateways to allow
  overriding their settings correctly
o firmware: refine ignore of temporary error 500 in GUI during upgrades
o firmware: default config has been adapted to set up new style
  dashboard entries during e.g. factory reset
o firmware: validate source and destination entries in NPT
o firmware: audited mirror list and disabled non-working entries
o services: do not show disabled DHCPv6 server when prefix delegation
  is not used
o services: do not run boot-up routines for proxy server and intrusion
  detection when disabled
o services: fix router advertisements subnet bits save
o intrusion detection: improved alert browsing with action filter
o proxy server: ACL setup can now include manual pre and post hooks
o wizard: fixed alignment of page titles and contents
o captive portal: ignore incomplete MAC entries to avoid premature
  logout of active user
o openvpn: fix display of selected CRL in server settings


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
