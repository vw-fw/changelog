Hi everyone,

We are skipping a bit ahead with 16.1.11 to address a CSRF vulnerability,
which outlines the path we have been on since we started[1] and we will
surely continue this security-aware trend.

In other news, this update includes native GeoIP alias support, captive
portal voucher customisations requested by many and the last batch of
Russian, effectively bringing it to 100% completed.  Wow!

Here is the full change log:

o services: fix CSRF vulnerability in status_services.php[2]
o www: strengthen CSRF secret generation for legacy pages
o dhcp: bring back usage of the authoritative directive
o system: allow periodic backups of RRD and DHCP for non-MFS
o openvpn: status page would not show the correct process status
o captive portal: add option for less secure passwords, password and username length
o firewall: add GeoIP aliases feature
o languages: completed Russian translation (contributed by Smart-Soft)
o languages: updated French


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
