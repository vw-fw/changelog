Hi there,

For more than 8 years now, Veritawall is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

23.1, nicknamed "Quintessential Quail", features Unbound DNS statistics with
a blocklist rewrite in Python, improved WAN SLAAC operability, firewall
alias BGP ASN type support, PHP 8.1, assorted FreeBSD networking updates,
MVC/API pages for packet capture/virtual IPs/IPsec connection management,
IPsec configuration file migration to swanctl.conf, new sslh plugin, ddclient
custom backend support (including Azure), WireGuard kernel module plugin
variant as the new default plus much more.

o src: assorted FreeBSD 13 stable fixes for e.g. bpf, bridge, bsdinstall ifconfig, iflib, ipfw, ipsec, lagg, netmap, pf, route and vlan components
o ports: php 8.1.14[11]
o ports: sudo 1.9.12p2[12]

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1_6:

o system: incorrect link to CARP status page on dashboard widget
o reporting: bail DNS resolve in traffic graphs when resolver is not configured
o captive portal: for static MAC assignments make sure that the IP address actually changed before updating it

o ipsec: myid may be be optional
o plugins: os-bind fix plugin directory path
o plugins: os-ddclient minor PHP fix
o plugins: os-frr allow restart via cron
o plugins: os-nut wrong user for latest port
o plugins: os-upnp typo in log level
o plugins: os-wireguard service widget fix

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
o StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
o The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
