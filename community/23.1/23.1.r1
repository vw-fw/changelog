Hi there,

For more than 8 years now, Veritawall is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3

o interfaces: heavy cleanup of the wireless device integration
o interfaces: use 802.1ad protocol for stacked VLAN parent (QinQ)
o interfaces: GIF and GRE now support subnet-based IPv6 configurations instead of always falling back to a point-to-point (/128) setup
o interfaces: GIF and GRE now disable IPv6 on IPv4 tunnels (contributed by Maurice Walker)
o interfaces: add PPPoEv6 mode to prevent IPv6 CP negotiation over PPPoE in other IPv6 modes
o interfaces: add support for SLAAC WAN interfaces without DHCPv6 (contributed by Maurice Walker)

o intrusion detection: reload grid after log drop (contributed by kulikov-a)
o ipsec: disable charon.install_routes completely in case upstream would implement it for FreeBSD later on
o ipsec: move user PSK (pre-shared key) and static PSK items to new MVC/API implementation
o ipsec: migrate existing configuration from ipsec.conf to swanctl.conf
o ipsec: add a new independent connections MVC/API component to manage IPsec in a layout matching swanctl.conf syntax more closely
o ipsec: rewrote lease status page in MVC/API
o ipsec: add configurable "unique" setting to phase 1
o monit: support start timeout setting (contributed by spoutin)
o openvpn: add unique daemon name to each instance
o unbound: add DNS statistics collector and reporting frontend
o unbound: safeguard retrieval of blocklist shortcode
o unbound: add exact domain blocking
o mvc: call plugins_interfaces() optionally on service reconfigure

o plugins: os-stunnel fixes missing include in certificate script
o plugins: os-wireguard switches to kernel module with a separate os-wireguard-go variant available for installation to keep the old behaviour
o plugins: os-sslh 1.0[7] (contributed by agh1467)
o src: assorted FreeBSD 13 stable fixes for e.g. bpf, bridge, bsdinstall ifconfig, iflib, ipfw, ipsec, lagg, netmap, pf, route and vlan components
o ports: php 8.1.13[8]
o ports: sqlite 3.40.1[9]

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o LibreSSL flavour has been discontinued.  Switch to OpenSSL flavour to proceed with the upgrade.
o StrongSwan IPsec configuration now uses the preferred swanctl.conf instead of the deprecated ipsec.conf which could lead to connectivity issues in ambiguous cases.  Subtle bugs cannot be ruled out as well so please raise an issue on GitHub to be able to investigate each case.
o The new IPsec connections pages and API create an independent set of connections following the design of swanctl.conf.  Legacy tunnel settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated.
