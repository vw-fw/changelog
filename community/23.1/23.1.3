Hello again,

This update was not planned as such, but an Sqlite compile change in FreeBSD
ports required a clean rebuild so instead of a hotfix we are shipping this tiny
stable update.

Here are the full patch notes:

o firewall: fix mismatch of options in new automatic listing of floating rules in interface rules
o ipsec: "Allow any remote gateway to connect" should suffix all in order to connect to the other end
o ipsec: store proper log values in advanced settings
o ipsec: add a routing hook and execute it for all VTI devices during reconfiguration
o ports: phpseclib 3.0.19[1]
o ports: sqlite backs out disabling DQS option which broke software on multiple ends
o ports: sudo 1.9.13p3[2]

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.3_4:

o firewall: fix rule display of inverted aliases
o firmware: add stub for previously removed -f option in veritawall-version


Stay safe,
Your Veritawall team
